# Action Reaction

## Overview

**Action Reaction** is an interactive party game app designed for fun group play. The concept is simple but highly engaging — one player holds the phone to their forehead while others act out clues for the player to guess the displayed word. It’s a mix of quick thinking, expressive acting, and laughter, making it a perfect game for parties, family gatherings, or casual hangouts.

## Game Concept

Each round begins when the player holding the phone starts the game. A random word from a selected topic (e.g., Food, Sports, or Movies) appears on the screen. The player cannot see the word — only the other participants can.

The others must then perform or describe the word **through actions only** (no speaking or spelling!). The player holding the phone must guess what the word is based on their actions.

When the player guesses:

* ✅ **Correct Guess:** The player tilts the phone **face-down** to mark it as correct.
* 🔁 **Pass:** If the player cannot guess or the other players are struggling to act it out, the player tilts the phone **face-up** to skip the word.

Each correct or skipped action moves the game to the next word automatically until the round timer ends.
